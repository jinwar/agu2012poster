%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Ultra high pressure (UHP) terranes are generally considered as continental crustal material being subducted to mantle depth and then exhumed to surface. The youngest UHP rocks in the world are found in the D'Entrecasteaux Islands, Papua New Guinea. These 7-8 Ma coesite-eclogite face rocks indicate different geological history from other UHP rocks for the exhumation process not associating with the subduction either spacially or temporally. The burial of these UHP rocks is thought to be during the arc-continent collision between Australian Plate and Papua New Guinea mainland about 58Ma ago (Lus et al., 2004, Ellis et al., 2011). And afterwards they remained mantle depth for ~30Ma before rapidly exhumed to surface from ~5Ma at the rate around 1cm/yr (Baldwin et al., 2004; Gordon et al., 2012). 

Evidences show strong relation between the exhumation and the west propagation of Woodlark Rift, which is an active transition zone from continental rifting to seafloor spreading. Strong crustal extension may favor the exhumation in two ways: reversing subduction that extract UHP continental crust along the paleo-subduction channel, or thinning the upperplate crust to help the buoyant UHP rocks penetrate through as diapirs.

In this study we investigate the dynamic processes driving uplift and extension using Rayleigh wave phase velocity imaging for both teleseismic and ambient noise measurement to explore the crust and upper mantle structure across this region.

  \headerbox{Ambient Noise}{name=noise,column=0,span=1,below=introduction}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Because short intra-station distance violate the far-field estimation of time-domain ambient noise method, we applied the original Aki's spectral formulation which was further developed by Eskstr\"{o}m et al., 2009. The key result of these papers can be presented as equation~\ref{eqn:aki}:
\begin{equation}
\bar{\rho}(r,\omega) = J_0\left(\frac{\omega}{c(\omega)}r \right)
\label{eqn:aki}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\rho}$ is the real part of normalized cross-spectrum, $c(\omega)$ is the phase velocity for different frequency $\omega$.

In this study, we fit the whole Bessel function in the interested frequency band instead of counting only zero-crossings of cross-spectrum.
